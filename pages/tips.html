  <h1>100 Bulletproof Python Tips That Will Instantly Make You A Better Developer</h1>

  <h2>Pythonista, how many Python tricks do you have up your sleeve?</h2>

  <p>Are you tired of reading through long tutorials where you've lost interest by the time you get to the actual code or meat of the subject?</p>

  <p>Are you so overwhelmed by the richness of the Python language that you're finding it difficult to learn the many different branches?</p>
  
  <p>Do you wonder how you can make your code more elegant, maintainable and Pythonic?</p>

  <p>This was certainly us when we started our Python journeys!</p>

  <p>One of Python's strengths is that while it's so deep and technical it's also a wonderful entry level programming language. This contrast though can be paralyzing for folks that want to go from doing things the ‚Äúbasic way‚Äù to doing things <i>the Python way</i>.</p>

  <p>There is an answer however and we have a solution that will once and for all make things more accessible for you. Read on to hear more... or just buy the book! We don't mind either way!</p>

  <h3>Enter our Python Tips ...</h3>

  </p>

  <p>This book contains small, practical pieces of Python code that <strong>will boost your knowledge of the language</strong>.</p>

  <p>We quickly realised that the sooner you start reading and applying code, the quicker you progress.</p>

  <p>As a result we've distilled almost 4 years of PyBites into a rich collection of tips that are insightful, practical, fun and presented in such a way that you can get straight to coding with them.</p>

  <p>You've probably seen some of these on social media in the last couple of years. They've helped thousands of developers worldwide improve their Python skills so we know they're good.</p>

  <p>These tips have reminded developers of Pythonic ways of doing things and why Python is such a great language to code in.</p>

  <h3>What's inside?</h3>

  <p>Let's take a quick tour.</p>

  <p>Firstly, you can consume the book in any order. Just pick out the topics you want to learn about or need the most at any given time.</p>

  <p><strong>We're always trying to battle the widespread tutorial paralysis we commonly see in the industry. That is NOT the experience we want you to have with us.</strong></p>

  <h4>Construct dictionaries</h4>
  
  <p>Head over to page 14 and you will learn how to construct a dictionary from 2 iterables (<i>one of our favorite idioms</i>).</p>

  <h4>Powerful sorting options</h4>

  <p>On page 19 you will discover how to sort any sequence by a callable you define. Your sorting skills will never be the same again (<i>when Julian dreams about Pythonic code, you bet beautiful sorting is part of it</i>).</p>

  <h4>Sentiment analysis</h4>

  <p>On page 26 you will learn about an exciting module to do sentiment analysis on a bunch of tweets.</p>

  <p>Yes, these tips go far beyond Python's standard library. You'll even learn some Django.</p>

  <h4>Builtins you want to know about</h4>

  <p>We are showing you a lot of built-ins that will make your life easier and your code more idiomatic.</p>

  <p>Head over to page 30 to learn about two elegant one-liners thanks to <code>any</code> and <code>all</code>.</p>

  <h4>Getting help</h4>

  <p>On page 36 we show you some invaluable ways to inspect objects in Python, an unmissable skill for any Python developer.</p>

  <h4>Itertools</h4>

  <p>Starting page 40 you will find two recipes to make an infinite iterator followed by how to get all combinations from a list.</p>

  <h4>What's up with __main__?</h4>

  <p>We also care about the newer Pythonitas.</p>

  <p>If you've wondered what <code>if __name__ == "__main__"</code> is about, we've got you covered on page 57.</p>

  <h4>OOP techniques</h4>

  <p>A lot of folks we talk with see OOP as THE magic they need to know to become proficient at Python. And they are partly right.</p>

  <p>We have several tips that cover this. On page 49 you'll see that everything is an object in Python (<i>this haunts Bob's dreams at times, in a good way</i>).</p>

  <p>On pages 61 and 99 we talk about object representation and how it helps debugging.</p>

  <p>OOP is really everywhere in the language and on page 66 you see a different dict constructor at work.</p>

  <p>Or what about powerful <code>Path</code> (pathlib) methods which you'll see on page 69?</p>

  <p>On page 83 you'll learn about the <code>callable</code> and <code>getattr</code> built-ins, and similarly on 98 you will learn about <code>attrgetter</code> from the operator module.</p>

  <p>Finally, do a search on <i>class</i> and you will see quite a few of them.</p>

  <p>We hope this covers enough OOP for starters ;)</p>

  <h4>Tooling</h4>

  <p>We go beyond Python by showing you some powerful tools.</p>

  <p>Head over to page 70 to use json.tool to validate JSON.</p>

  <p>On page 71 we create a gif image using the imageio library.</p>

  <p>Then on page 78 you'll learn about the cool howdoi tool to search for code snippets using the command line.</p>

  <p>And on page 109 you will learn about Django extensions.</p>

  <h4>How __all__ can save you</h4>

  <p>We also think about people writing modules for other developers' consumption.</p>

  <p>On page 88 you will learn about a technique to encapsulate your code so that even somebody doing an <code>import *</code> won't see all your stuff ...</p>

  <h4>Robust testing techniques</h4>
  <p>We are keen on writing test code so expect to find pytest / testing related tips as well:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>On page 92 you will learn how to make your test code more DRY (don't repeat yourself)</li>
    <li>On page 93 you learn how to mock out web services in your tests (similarly on page 47 you will learn how to cache API calls).</li>
    <li>On page 100 you will learn about the <code>assert_called_with</code> method.</li>
    <li>On page 101 you will learn how to access an exception string caught by <code>pytest.raises</code>.</li>
    <li>And on page 106 you will learn about how to test datetimes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Useful datetime methods</h4>

  <p>And speaking of datetimes, on page 53 we look at the calendar module which made it relatively easy to build our (Seinfeld) coding streak calendar on our platform.</p>

  <p>You will learn about fuzzy parsing using the powerful dateutil library on page 96.</p>

  <p>And you will learn about what day of the week, and what week of the year it is on pages 110 and 111.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>We hope you'll agree by now that there is a lot to learn.</p>

  <p>We're actually positively surprised we were able to fit this into just 117 pages!</p>

  <p>And as our tips are so practical, <strong>we cannot wait to see you putting all of this into your own code</strong>.</p>

  <h3>Exercises</h3>

  <p>This brings us to the exercising part.</p>

  <p>Where relevant we have linked exercises you can take on our coding platform.</p>

  <p>Remember: <strong>retention increases 3-5 fold when you put what you learn into practice</strong>.</p>

  <p>We even recommend you teach what you learn here to benefit from a 10X retention rate. </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">

  </p>

  <h3>How our community experiences our tips</h3>

  <p>Our tips are widely acclaimed by the Python community as being revealing, helpful, insightful, Pythonic, practical (they can be implemented immediately in one's code base), and fun. </p>

  <p style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://pybites-tips.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/tips-chrisw.png" alt="Our tips are well received by our community" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px !important; margin: 20px auto;">
  </p>

  <p>Somebody even said they are the cherries on our coding platform cake. üç∞</p>

  <p>The general consensus is that people became better Pythonistas by being exposed to these tips!</p>

  <h3>Try it yourself, at our risk</h3>

  <p>We believe so strongly in this book and the gold within that we're willing to take the full risk.</p>

  <p>If, after reading it, you find you've not learned at least 1 or 2 new things (within 30 days of purchase), <strong>we'll happily refund you the complete price of the book</strong>. No questions asked <i>AND</i> you get to keep the book.</p>

  <h3>Lock in future updates</h3>

  <p>But there's more! </p>

  <p>You're actually going to get many more tips over the coming months! </p>
