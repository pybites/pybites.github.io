  <h1>Your Ticket to a Greater Contribution and More Freedom</h1>

  <p>Ever since we read Tim Ferriss' <i>4 hour workweek</i> we knew <strong>running a business</strong> was something we wanted to end up doing.</p>

  <p>It's one of the most fulfilling things you can do, but also one of the hardest things you will ever do!</p>

  <p>However if you are passionate about helping other people succeed you already won half of the battle.</p>

  <p>The other important thing to realize is that becoming an entrepreneur / creating a business <strong>you can do this at scale</strong>.</p>

  <p>In the training below we share <strong>5 lessons we learned building PyBites</strong>. We hope this will inspire and convince you that this is actually a pretty attainable goal!</p>

  <p>Watch it, then <strong>go take action</strong>. And if you want some advice and/or build out your business app idea with our help, book a call below.</p>

  <p>Best,<br>Bob and Julian from PyBites</p>

  <p><strong>Coming soon ...</strong></p>
