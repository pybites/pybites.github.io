  <h1>The One Thing Every Programmer Should Do ...</h1>

  <p>Do you have a Python blog?</p>

  <p>If you landed on this page the answer is probably <i>No</i>. But don't worry, we are going to fix this together ...</p>

  <p>When you are a programmer one of the most important seeds that you can plant and cultivate is a <strong>tech blog</strong>.</p>

  <p>It not only will shape your tech and communication skills, it will actually become your gravitational <strong>asset</strong> that will continuously attract opportunity.</p>

  <p>That is, <strong>people will reach out to you</strong> instead of the other way around.</p>

  <p>In the training below we will show you how to get a tech blog up and running in ~20 min using <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> and <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com" target="_blank">Pelican</a>.</p>

  <p>We will also cover <strong>what</strong> to write about and how PyBites started <i>as just a blog</i> and how we leveraged this vehicle to niche down and seek new opportunity.</p>

  <p>Get ready to take some serious action this month ... and remember: keep it fun as you go!</p>

  <p>- Bob and Julian (PyBites)</p>

  <p>When you have your blog successfully up and running, write one or two (short) articles, then share a <strong>WIN</strong> in our <i>#checkins-and-wins</i> channel on our Slack:</p>
