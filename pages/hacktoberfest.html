  <h1>It's Time to Start Contributing to Open Source</h1>

  <p>As we write this it's October 2020 and that means it's <a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank">Hacktoberfest</a> again.</p>

  <p>The goal for your this month to open <strong>4 <i>valid</i> pull requests</strong>, getting your code out there, giving back to the community.</p>

  <p>But wait ... What is a valid PR though? How to be confident enough to do this? What projects to contribute to? And how to tactically go about opening a Pull Request?</p>

  <p>No worries, PyBites has you covered! In this training you will learn all that and more.</p>

  <p>We'd be super stoked if this training actually makes you take this critical step in your developer career. For us our first couple of pull requests (and reviews) marked a clear <i>before and after</i> in our developer careers.</p>

  <p>Don't let this opportunity pass by, take action today:</p>
