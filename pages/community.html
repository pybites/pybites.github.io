  <h1>Join the Most Welcoming and Engaging Python Community on the Planet</h1>

  <p><i>The PyBites Slack Channel is an excellent example of how friendly the Python community is. The founders, Bob and Julian, took the time to reach out to me and to chat with me. I felt very welcome as a fresh Pythonista. - Sophia B</i></p>

  <p><i>The slack community is an invaluable resource, everyone tries to help one another, anyway they can. We all need help, some time or the other, I know I did. I was stuck somewhere, I posted about it and someone helped me regain my confidence. - Samuel U</i></p>

  <p>As Jim Rohn said: "Success leaves clues", well here you'll get quite a few and totally free (yes, this is so valuable we could be charging for this, but we don't because first and foremost we want to help you!)</p>

  <p>Again, you don't have to go at it alone. Join below and meet some of the most awesome Pythonistas in the industry ...</p>

  <p><i>The PyBites Slack Community is now like a second family to me. I now know some of the people on this community better then work colleagues who I've shared an office with for 15 years.  - David C.</i></p>

  <p>We hope to salute you soon!</p>

  <p>- Bob and Julian (PyBites)</p>
