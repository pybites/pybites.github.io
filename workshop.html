  <h1>Accelerate Your Career Using Python + a Developer Mindset</h1>

  <p>Are you stuck in a boring job that you want to walk away from but can't because it's paying the bills?</p>

  <p>Do you feel you are an advanced beginner or intermediate Pythonista, but you would not call yourself an <i>application developer</i>, because something is missing, a gap in your skill set, and you are not even 100% sure how to bridge it?</p>

  <p>Do you want to <strong>earn more</strong>, do <strong>more fulfilling work</strong> and have <strong>complete freedom</strong> over your schedule?</p>

  <p>Start planting the seed today by watching our <strong>Developer Workshop</strong>. You'll learn:<ul>
    <li>The common <strong>tech industry pitfalls</strong> that can seriously hold you back.</li>
    <li>What <strong>imposter syndrome</strong> is and how it can cripple you from getting out there, sharing your code and contributing to open source.</li>
    <li>How our <strong>pragmatic methodology</strong> will have you retain 9 times (!) more of what you learn.</li>
    <li>How <strong>Python is only a relatively small part</strong> of the whole picture and that <i>the other career accelerators</i> are less obvious than you might think ...</li>
    <li>How a Mark Twain quote <strong>changed everything</strong> for us ...</li>
    <li>How our <strong>surprisingly simple blueprint</strong> creates <i>well-rounded developers</i> ...</li>
  </ul></p>
