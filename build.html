  <h1>Build Real World Applications Using Python</h1>

  <p>Have you ever experienced the look of surprise / delight on your colleagues' faces when they save time using <strong>an app you built</strong>?</p>
  
  <p>To us, and many people we've spoken with, <i>this</i> feeling is unbeatable and seriously leads to an everlasting <strong>joy of coding</strong>!</p>

  <p>Heck, your project or app idea might even grow out into a business, just like it did for us.</p>

  <h2>4 things that stop you from getting there</h2>

  <p>There are 4 common hurdles that prevent people from getting to this level:</p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>They spend way too much time on books, videos and courses (aka <strong>tutorial paralysis</strong>), no time actually shipping software.</li>
      <li>They are comfortable in the realm of scripting (and consider themselves scripters), but shy away from taking on <strong>bigger projects</strong> (<i>spoiler alert</i>: This is exactly what gets you from an intermediate to advanced Pythonista!)</li>
      <li>They think they lack the <strong>required developer skills</strong> to pull it off (We commonly hear: <i>How do I best structure my app? How do I write quality / maintainable code? How should I test my code?</i>)</li>
      <li>Hampered by <strong>Imposter Syndrome</strong>, they are not putting their code / app / project out there and are missing out on crucial feedback loops (e.g. code critique) that are necessary to grow. Remember, you don't know what you don't know ...</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>And don't think it's just you, we've seen many people being crippled by one, or more often, all of these roadblocks.</p>

  <h2>Time to change your approach</h2>

  <p>Let's fix all of this! Since launching PyBites back in 2016 we've helped thousands of people with their Python and projects.</p>

  </p>

  <p>People working with us have landed more lucrative jobs, started contributing to open source, or launched their own gigs, seriously boosting their market value (FYI: as per DevSkiller.com, the average US Python dev salary ranges from $80-120K).</p>

  <p>The good news is that it's easier than you might think. <strong>Building your dream app using Python is well within your reach</strong> and we want to show you how ...</p>

  <p><strong>Book a strategy session with us</strong> and we'll get you unstuck. These might actually be the best 45 minutes you'll spend talking about your Python journey this year.</p>

  <p>Oh and by the way, this consult with us is totally <strong>free</strong>, so don't put it off:</p>

  <h2>Some numbers</h2>

  <p>In terms of the approach most people take learning Python, they are not as effective as they could be. You need to <strong>apply what you learn</strong> and <strong>building practical projects</strong> is the best bang for your buck. The numbers don't lie:</p>

    <h2>Drew K - Overcoming Imposter Syndrome by Building Actual Apps</h2>

    <img src="https://pb-cc-avatars-private.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/drew.png" alt="meet Drew" class="profilePic">

    <p>I had run into a brick wall in my career. Overworked, frustrated, and tired of pursuing something I have been working to achieve for years; land a job as a Python Developer.</p>

    <p>I decided to sign-up for the PyBites Developer Mindset Program after a couple of meetings with Bob. Those meetings with Bob showed me he was authentic and cared about his craft and helping people become better versions of themselves.</p>

    <p>Before the program, I was in a coding rut with a side of imposter syndrome. As those who may have experienced this know, it can be pretty crippling. Working with Bob proved to be worth the price of admission. I learned an incredible amount during a short time frame while boosting my confidence tremendously.</p>

    <p>I am in a place now where I'm confident I will land the role I am seeking. With Julian & Bob's mentorship and a focused plan, I was able to overcome the mental blocks I had developed over the years.</p>

    <p>If you're looking to improve your skills in Python while building actual applications, consider signing up for this program. You will only get back what you deposit. Invest in yourself.</p>

    <h2>Robin B - Becoming a successful Python Developer at an Energy Startup</h2>

    <img src="https://pb-cc-avatars-private.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/robin.jpeg" alt="meet Robin" class="profilePic">

    <p>The PyBites Developer Mindset Program has given me confidence and clarity in direction and allowed me to make life changing decisions regarding my career.</p>

    <p>Julian and Bob helped me see that I was underappreciated in my job and was wasting my time there.</p>

    <p>In a relatively short period of time I gained the Python and leadership skills, self-awareness and confidence I needed to become a successful Python developer / data scientist in an Energy Startup.</p>

    <h2>Alex K - Coded his Dream Project, Improved Python and Boosted Confidence</h2>

    <img src="https://pb-cc-avatars-private.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/alex.jpeg" alt="meet Alex" class="profilePic">

    <p>I had reached a point where I did not want to continue coding. I was faced with a choice: stay on the same level and go slow or get started on the bigger projects I always wanted to build.</p>

    <p>I decided to do something bigger, but I did not know how to carry out the large parts of that project technically.</p>

    <p>The PyBites Developer Mindset Program helped me push my experience to collaborate, choose the right custom framework and formulate my project drafts using real software design principles.</p>

    <p>Julian and Bob not only guided me on what I needed to know but, as an unexpected bonus, taught me the skills and mindset I needed to be confident in myself and my coding ability.</p>

    <p>The improvements to my Python and newfound self-confidence made in just a few weeks would have undoubtedly taken me 10 years to achieve without the coaching in this program.</p>

    <h2>Piotr R - Becoming a Confident Django Web Developer</h2>

    <img src="https://pb-cc-avatars-private.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/piotr.jpeg" alt="meet Piotr" class="profilePic">

    <p>I seriously improved my coding and software design skills through the PyBites Developer Mindset Program.</p>

    <p>My biggest win was building 2 real world Django web apps from scratch (I was new to this framework), getting them to work end-to-end, then deploying them to Heroku.</p>

    <p>The way we collaborated on Github as developers gave me a constant push and motivation to up my game. Sometimes I got uncomfortable but that was when I actually learned the most.</p>

    <p>The skills I learned through this program seriously boosted my confidence and put me on the map to land a software developer job, which is taking my career to the next level (I'm now interviewing!)</p>

    <h2>Punit J - Becoming an Open Source Contributor</h2>

    <img src="https://pb-cc-avatars-private.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/punit.jpeg" alt="meet Punit" class="profilePic">

    <p>PyBites Developer Mindset has given me the technical knowledge, methodologies and confidence to pursue a career as a developer and contribute to open source.</p>

    <p>This is something I always wanted to do but never knew where to start. The confidence I gained by building actual web applications allowed me to reach out to other developers and start contributing to an important open source project.</p>

    <h2>Daniel S - From Newbie to Confident Pythonista</h2>

    <img src="https://pb-cc-avatars-private.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/daniel.jpeg" alt="meet Daniel" class="profilePic">

    <p>When I started the PyBites Developer Mindset Program I was a total newbie. When I saw people programming "like pros" on YouTube, I felt I would never be able to code like them.</p>

    <p>Throughout the program though, I got up-to-speed with Python in record time. More importantly I became a critical thinker, developing a 360º view of my coding skills and how I could become more valuable to my current employer and the market.</p>
