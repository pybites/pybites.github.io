<p>Lessons learned during the making of pyTrack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a guest post by Martin, a passionate Pythonista who turns our code challenges into cool projects. In this article he describes his process of building <a href="https://github.com/clamytoe/pyTrack/">pyTrack</a>, a simple task time tracker. Quoting the Readme:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pyTrack helps you keep track of how much time you spend on your projects and tasks. A sqlite database is used to track your time logs, and it is kept simple by only implementing as few commands as needed to get a full featured application. You can add/remove multiple projects, start/stop tracking any of them, or completely reset the database to start with a clean slate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only did he learn various Python modules - PeeWee, Maya and Click - he also stunned us delivering a project with great documentation (check out <a href="https://github.com/clamytoe/pyTrack/blob/master/README.md">the README</a>!) and properly packaged code. </p>
<p>Enter Martin:</p>
<h2>PyBites Challenge #23</h2>
<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://pybit.es/codechallenge23.html">this challenge</a>, my interest was immediately peaked. It sounded like something that I could use myself on a regular basis. I knew from the get go that I wanted to use <a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/maya">Maya</a> for keeping track of the timestamps so I installed it and got to work. Things were going great: I wrote up my classes and was able to create objects and save timestamps, pull them back out and get time intervals and such.</p>
<p>It seemed like a relatively simple challenge. I knew that I needed a database back-end and didn't want to use <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> again, so I decided to up the stakes a bit by using <a href="https://github.com/coleifer/peewee">PeeWee</a> ORM. </p>
<p>I'm usually able to figure things out by checking the docs and playing around with the code. Time was not on my side this time though so I could only work on this sporadically over a couple of weeks. It was hard going at first. I mostly struggled with getting to know how to use PeeWee. Maya on the other hand was relatively easy to pick up.</p>
<h2>PeeWee and Maya</h2>
<p>One thing was certain: all of the work that I had already put into creating the classes and tests for this would have to be tossed and replaced with the class models for <em>PeeWee</em>...</p>
<p>Figuring out a one-to-many relationship was one of my first hurdles. I read the docs a bit and looked at some quick tutorials. They were very basic, so my implementation ended up basic. I recently came across <a href="http://blog.adnansiddiqi.me/develop-database-driven-applications-in-python-with-peewee/">Adnan's Random bytes</a> blog, that would have came in really handy when I was first developing this. The way he sets his relationships is how I should have done it.</p>
<p>Another thing that threw me off was not being able to save <em>MayaDT</em> objects into the database. Only I didn't realize that it was the problem that I was having! The error messages from PeeWee were really cryptic and hard to follow.</p>
<p>After a few days of cursing and messing around with it, it finally hit me! <em>PeeWee</em> was expecting me to store <em>datetime</em> objects because that's what I had declared them as in the models! As soon as I converted the <em>Maya</em> objects into the correct format, I was able to get the ball rolling.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">timestamp</span> <span class="o">=</span> now<span class="o">()</span>.datetime<span class="o">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The next issue was when I would pull those timestamps back out to get my time intervals, <em>Maya</em> was not having it. Fortunate for me, the author of <em>Maya</em>, had already solved that problem. Instead of using the normal <em>MayaInterval()</em> I had to do it this way:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">interval</span> <span class="o">=</span> MayaInterval.from_datetime<span class="o">()</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now you would think that would be it, but no, that introduced another issue. See, with the normal <em>MayaInterval</em> method, your local timezone is automatically determined and taken care of. Not so with the <em>.from_datetime()</em> one. It took me a while to figure out why it was failing when it had all been working before the addition of <em>PeeWee</em>.</p>
<p>It turns out that I couldn't simply just use the <em>datetime</em> entries that I had placed into the database. I had to first get the timezone and then feed that into <em>.from_datetime()</em>. The timezone object has many properties, the one that I was interested in was <strong>zone</strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># set local timezone</span>
<span class="nv">timezone</span> <span class="o">=</span> get_localzone<span class="o">()</span>
<span class="nv">local_tz</span> <span class="o">=</span> timezone.zone

<span class="c1"># import datetime objects from database</span>
...

<span class="c1"># parse them into the proper formats</span>
<span class="nv">start</span> <span class="o">=</span> parse<span class="o">(</span>log.start_time<span class="o">)</span>.datetime<span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">to_timezone</span><span class="o">=</span>local_tz, <span class="nv">naive</span><span class="o">=</span>True<span class="o">)</span>
<span class="nv">stop</span>  <span class="o">=</span> parse<span class="o">(</span>log.stop_time<span class="o">)</span>.datetime<span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">to_timezone</span><span class="o">=</span>local_tz, <span class="nv">naive</span><span class="o">=</span>True<span class="o">)</span>

<span class="c1"># get the interval</span>
<span class="nv">duration</span> <span class="o">=</span> MayaInterval.from_datetime<span class="o">(</span>start, stop<span class="o">)</span>.timedelta
</pre></div>


<p>The <em>timedelta</em> converts the interval object into <em>0:00:00</em> format, which is exactly what I wanted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note from PyBites: we definitely recognize this kind of struggle using new modules and technologies. This is why we encourage learning by code challenges. Reading a book about technology only gets you so far. It's when you start <em>using</em> the technology that you run in many (context) specific issues. This can be frustrating, but practice enough and you will be on your way to mastery. We think Martin's <em>pyTrack</em> is a great example of this.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>User interface - plan ahead!</h2>
<p>Once everything was working smoothly, I remembered that I wanted to make this into a command-line utility. </p>
<p>A common mistake is to just start coding which often leads to having to rewrite a lot of your code. In that regard I think next time I’ll build out the command-line interface first and then add the code for it. </p>
<p>I started to add <a href="https://github.com/pallets/click">Click</a> to get the CLI functionality. I had already used Click before so I thought that it would be pretty easy to add it as an afterthought. Boy was I wrong!</p>
<p>Let's just say that I patched it onto my existing code but then had to refactor the whole thing out once again so that the command-line portion of the code would be its own separate file. This will make it easier to add a GUI later on, if I get the motivation to do it.</p>
<p>My biggest roadblock here was in trying to get the project listing to show whenever no arguments were passed. None of the documentation or tutorials that I found showed how to do this. Took me a while to figure out that you have to call the method that starts off <em>Click</em> and since every example that I ran into in the wild started out that way, I thought it was a requirement.</p>
<p>I modified my main function so that it would look for command-line arguments and take action appropriately.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>...
        <span class="k">if</span> len<span class="o">(</span>argv<span class="o">)</span> &gt; <span class="m">1</span>:
            cli<span class="o">()</span>
        <span class="k">else</span>:
            <span class="nv">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> get_projects<span class="o">(</span><span class="nv">display</span><span class="o">=</span>True<span class="o">)</span>
...
</pre></div>


<p>I have that portion of the code wrapped in other code that opens and closes the connection to the database. I found it easier to do it this way instead of using function decorators.</p>
<h2>Packaging</h2>
<p>Last but not least came time to package the whole thing. PyBites wrote up <a href="https://pybit.es/python-packaging.html">an excellent tutorial</a> on how to do it, so I won't repeat it here. I actually learned from it myself and implemented some of it on this project, so go and have a read.</p>
<p>I should also give a shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/dbader_org">Dan Bader</a> and thank him for his excellent <a href="https://dbader.org/blog/write-a-great-readme-for-your-github-project">README-Template for your GitHub project</a>, which I use on every single project that I write. It takes your documentation from being so so, up to pro level!</p>
<p>I haven’t covered a lot about actually using my project. I think I did a pretty good job of explaining how it works in the <a href="https://github.com/clamytoe/pyTrack">README</a>, so check it out for yourself and feel free to contact me with any suggestions on how to improve it.</p>
<p>One more bit of advice when starting your own projects. Do a quick <strong>pip</strong> search for your potential project name.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip search pyTrack
</pre></div>


<p>I wasn't planning on pushing this out to <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">pypi</a>, but now that I'm considering it I'm running into the problem that <strong>pyTrack</strong> is already taken! Not only will I have to come up with a new name, but I'm also going to have to rename my GitHub repo to reflect the change.</p>
<p>Conclusion: put in a little bit of leg work at the beginning and save yourself the hassle. </p>
